# Habitual Instinct

Arduino sketch for my first prototype of an idea realted around avoident robots and recreating specific personality traits around them. In this case creating a lack of confidence style of behaviour to a machine.

The piece scans the area infront of it's sensors and returns to the location that it detects to have the an object, wall or barrier furthest from it.
